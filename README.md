# Seamless Karma for Chrome

A simple Chrome extension that integrates [Seamless.com](http://www.seamless.com)
and [SeamlessKarma.com](http://www.seamlesskarma.com) together. Currently,
the extension detects corporate orders placed on Seamless, and records them
on SeamlessKarma. In the future, it may also support querying SeamlessKarma
for unused funds, reporting that information on the Seamless order page, and
automatically applying the unused funds to your order.
